                <h2>Advice</h2>
                <h3><strong>Buying right device is about making the right trade-offs.</strong> The best device for someone else might not be the best device for you.</h3>

                <p>For example, a phone with a large screen is easier to see and better for watching videos, but is harder to hold and will drain your battery more quickly.</p>

                <p>When it comes to purchasing new devices, most people usually do one of three things: they go to a store and ask for advice, search the internet for ideas, or ask their friends. Unfortunately, each of these has drawbacks:
                </p>

                <a role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#store" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="store">Going To The Store</a>
                <div class="collapse" id="store">
                    <div class="well">
                        <p>Going to a store takes up your time, and store employees rarely have the depth of tech knowledge that is necessary to provide good advice. The biggest problem with going to a store, however, is that phone carriers and tech retailers have an incentive to sell you the devices that make them the most money. Usually, that means that they recommend the most expensive devices, along with as many pricey accessories and unnecessary warranties as possible.</p>
                        <p><strong>The TechFriend alternative:</strong> Our flat fee covers the time we spend helping you. Unlike retailers and cell service carriers, we have no incentive to recommend anything but the best device for you. You pay exactly what we pay for the devices we deliver and set up. PS, speaking of warranties: Did you know that most credit cards offer a year of extended manufacturer warranty for free when you pay for a device with your card? We bet the stores won't tell you that.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <br>
                <a role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#internet" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="internet">Search The Internet</a>
                <div class="collapse" id="internet">
                    <div class="well">
                        <p>
                            Usually, when people look on the internet for a device such as a smart phone, they begin by searching "what is the best smart phone". The problem is that "the best smartphone" doesn't exist. Different people have different needs. In order to make a deeply informed decision of what smartphone to buy, the average consumer would need to understand the entire smartphone market, the multitude of devices that exist, and what all the functionality means in real life (for example, what's the difference between a 300 ppi screen vs. a 500 ppi screen?).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We freely admit that all of the information needed to purchase the perfect device can be found on the internet. However, this could require spending many hours or even days and weeks reading tech blogs. Finally, even if you do the research, the personal tech landscape is changing so quickly that you'll likely need to spend just as much time the next time you need a new device.
                        </p>

                            Having often been the friends who people call for tech advice, we sympathize with this approach. We love talking to our friends and helping them find the best devices. Unfortunately, we've noticed that a lot of tech hobbyists are less excited to spend hours helping their friends and family with their tech questions.
